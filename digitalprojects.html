        <h3> Twine essay</h3>
        <p> I'm currently playing around with Twine in order to incorporate it into future teaching projects for argumentative essays. I'll post something here or on GitHub when there's anything interesting to look at.</p>
        
        <h3>Text mining poem</h3>
        <p>I have been thinking about this particular poem idea for quite a while, but I haven't been able to obtain the source texts I wanted to draw from. Hopefully with adeqaute tinkering I can present bits and pieces soon. </p>
        
        <h3>Memes and other graphic projects</h3>
        <p>This also seems like a valuable exercise to do with students: have them experiment with communicational possibilities afforded by memes and other graphic components. What has been holding me back from posting my own meme experiments is their potential silliness. Maybe I'll post some soon nonetheless.</p>
