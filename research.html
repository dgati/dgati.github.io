        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>My research examines culturally divergent digital media, media practices, and cultures informed by frameworks from platform studies, interface analysis, digital humanities, and queer theory. </p><p>
            I'm currently at work on my first book project, which analyzes how digital media interfaces construct different lifeworlds depending on the cultural contexts of their media ecology, and studies the histories of such different digital landscapes.</p>
       <p> My second book project tackles the question of queer embodiment in virtual spaces, asking about the forms and practices of queer life that animate the 0's amd 1's of code, centering the queer human body in the virtuality of cyberspace.</p>

        <p>I have been contributing regularly to the Hungarian queer/lesbian magazine <a href="http://qlit.hu">qlit.hu</a>, where I write about topics important to the emerging Hungarian queer/lesbian community. My writings are  informed by my queer theoretical perspective, but I enjoy trying to make them accessible to a wide audience.</p>
